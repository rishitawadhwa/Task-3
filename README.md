# Task-3
In this task, I performed SQL-based data analysis on a sample E-commerce database using MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQLite syntax. I wrote queries using SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, and GROUP BY clauses, performed JOINs between customers and orders tables, and applied subqueries and aggregate functions like SUM and AVG. I also created a view for the top 10 customers based on total sales and suggested indexing for optimization. Realistic outputs were generated from a sample dataset and saved as CSV files for documentation. Through this task, I strengthened my skills in structured data querying, analysis, and optimization using SQL.
